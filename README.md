## Setup Steps

Setting up a new machine is done in two parts.  

### Part 1: Install (Apps, Shell, Dotfiles, etc.)
- Sign into the Mac App Store so that `mas` will be able to install App Store apps
- Run `sh ./install.sh`
- Update some settings in **iTerm**
    - Select a Powershell patched font for iTerm (Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text)
        - Currently, I'm using `Inconsolata for Powerline`
    - Select a color theme for iTerm (Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Colors ‚Üí Color Presets)
        - Currently, I'm using `Solarized Dark`
    - Turn on [Natural Text Selection](#natural-text-selection)

### Part 2: Setup (Tooling and Configurations)
- Launch **iTerm** (see your snazzy new setup)
- Run `sh ./setup.sh`
- Add license keys/logins for:
    - Git Tower
    - Sketch
    - Adobe CC (I also have to individually download the Adobe apps I use in CC üôÑ)
- Setup a new GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for this machine

## Appendix

### Natural Text Selection
By default, word jumps (option + ‚Üí or ‚Üê) and word deletions (option + backspace) do not work. To enable these, go to "iTerm ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Keys ‚Üí Load Preset... ‚Üí Natural Text Editing ‚Üí Boom!
