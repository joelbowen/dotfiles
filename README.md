Welcome to my dotfiles! I was inspired by [many others](#credits) before me, I created this repo by borrowing bits and pieces from other great repos, and building on them.

## Maintenance

### Manage global node packages

To update the list of globally installed node packages, run:

`./node/update-global-node-pkgs.mjs`

_Requires that [zx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zx) is already installed to run properly_

To install global node packages, run:

`sh ./scripts/install-global-node-pkgs.sh`

### Symlink new dotfiles

1. Add your dotfile to this directory
2. Run `sh ./install/symlinks.sh`

## New Machine

Setting up a new machine is easy, done in two parts.

### Part 1: Install (Apps, Shell, Dotfiles, etc.)

1. Sign into the Mac App Store so that `mas` will be able to install App Store apps
2. Run `sh ./install.sh`
3. Update some settings in **iTerm**
   - Select a Powershell patched font for iTerm (Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text)
     - Currently, I'm using `Inconsolata for Powerline`
   - Select a color theme for iTerm (Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Colors ‚Üí Color Presets)
     - Currently, I'm using `Solarized Dark`
   - Turn on [Natural Text Selection](#natural-text-selection)

### Part 2: Setup (Tooling and Configurations)

1. Launch **iTerm** (see your snazzy new setup)
2. Run `sh ./setup.sh`
3. Add license keys/logins for:
   - Git Tower
   - Sketch
   - Adobe CC (I also have to individually download the Adobe apps I use in CC üôÑ)
   - Navicat for PostgreSQL
4. Setup a new GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for this machine

## Appendix

### Natural Text Selection

By default, word jumps (option + ‚Üí or ‚Üê) and word deletions (option + backspace) do not work. To enable these, go to "iTerm ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Keys ‚Üí Load Preset... ‚Üí Natural Text Editing ‚Üí Boom! Head explodes" (_Credit: [Kevin Smets](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)_)
